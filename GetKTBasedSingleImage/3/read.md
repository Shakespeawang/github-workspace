# Camera Mode Parameter Optimization
An interface and an example of optimizing the camera intrinsic paramters, extrinsic paramters and distortion paramters which were estimated through a single planar image based on the fact that the planar points coordinate and the corresponding image points coordinate, and the principal point and image size were given was provided by this project.
